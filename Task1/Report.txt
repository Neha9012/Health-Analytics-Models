Disease Prediction Model Report
1. Dataset Overview:
The dataset used for this analysis is the Heart Disease Prediction Dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 14 features related to patient health, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

2. Data Preprocessing:
Missing Values: Missing values were handled by imputing missing entries for continuous features with the median and for categorical features with the mode.
Normalization: All continuous features were normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to ensure that the models perform optimally.
Categorical Features: Features like sex, cp, thal, and others were encoded using one-hot encoding to transform them into numerical values for model compatibility.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Feature Distributions: We visualized the distributions of key features using histograms to understand their spread. For example, the age feature showed a roughly normal distribution, while chol (cholesterol) displayed a right-skewed distribution.
Correlation Analysis: A correlation heatmap was generated to identify relationships between features. Strong correlations were observed between chol (cholesterol) and the target variable, indicating its potential importance in predicting heart disease.
4. Model Performance:
Three different models were used to predict the likelihood of heart disease: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.85	0.83	0.87	0.85
Random Forest	0.89	0.88	0.90	0.89
SVM	0.87	0.85	0.88	0.86
Logistic Regression: Performed well with an accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.83, and recall of 0.87. The F1-score of 0.85 indicates a balance between precision and recall.
Random Forest: Outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 0.89, precision of 0.88, and recall of 0.90. The F1-score of 0.89 indicates a strong model that can identify patients at high risk with high accuracy.
SVM: Also performed well with an accuracy of 0.87, precision of 0.85, and recall of 0.88, with a slightly lower F1-score of 0.86.
5. Conclusion:
Best Performing Model: The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance overall with an accuracy of 0.89, precision of 0.88, recall of 0.90, and F1-score of 0.89. This model is recommended for identifying patients with heart disease.
Model Comparisons: While Logistic Regression is simpler and faster, Random Forest outperforms it in accuracy and recall. SVM also showed good performance but did not surpass Random Forest.
Improvements: Hyperparameter tuning and further model selection (such as ensemble methods) could enhance the performance even further.
Future Directions: Exploring deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, or integrating more features (such as lifestyle factors) could improve prediction capabilities.
